## Background Context

### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!

Before starting, please read the **AirBnB** concept page.

**First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.**

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place…) that inherit from BaseModel
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
  
### What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

A command interpreter is like the air traffic controller for your computer. It takes your commands and tells the system what to do. Cool, right?

## Getting Started:

1. **Run Your Terminal:** Open that black box (or whatever color you prefer). It's your command cockpit.

2. **Navigate:**
   - `cd <directory>`: Move around.
   - `ls`: List files.
   - `pwd`: Show where you are.

3. **Execute Commands:**
   - Just type and hit Enter. Like magic.

## Commands to Impress:

- **`echo <message>`:** Make your terminal speak.
- **`mkdir <folder-name>`:** Birth a new folder.
- **`touch <file-name>`:** Create a file.

## Power Moves:

- **`cp <source> <destination>`:** Copy stuff.
- **`mv <source> <destination>`:** Move stuff.
- **`rm <file>`:** Delete stuff. Be careful.

## Your Ace Commands:

- **`history`:** See your command history.
- **`!n`:** Repeat the nth
